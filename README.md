# glider_mixed_layer_LS
Lake Superior's mixed layer meatbolism study using glider data

The Glider_metabolism_Script.R is the r file we used to get daily metabolic variables from glider data
ETRM file calculates daily relative thermal resistance to mixing values calculated from glider data
epi_chl_corrected calculates daily chlorophyl concentration after sundown each day to account for non-photochemical quenching 
GAMM_models.R file contains generalised additive models used in the manuscript
